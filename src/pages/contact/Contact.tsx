              The classic. Use this if you don't want to create an account on
              any of the social media platforms I'm using myself, or if it's
              something more formal you'd like to talk about. Keep in mind that
              I have a spam folder here as well.

              Remember what I said about YouTube a jiffy ago? Well, this is
              where most of my animated works and videos end up, all striving to
              reach their destiny: Overtaking the Wii Disc Channel in views.
              There will be a party for sure.

              The thing with my server is: I put so much effort into it, even
              created a custom sub domain redirecting to the invite link, yet I
              barely put any effort into bringing activity in there. So, if you
              like inactive servers, this is the place to go.
