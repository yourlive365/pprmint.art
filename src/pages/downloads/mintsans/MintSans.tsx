              There were so many things I disliked about the first version I
              wanted to fix with the next version. A few of those ideas were
              listed in my YouTube video where I've shown what I've beenworking
              on in the first half of 2020.

              Things I mainly improved with this version are the numbers and
              lowercase characters. I also slightly tweaked some numbers, very
              few capitals and how high certain glyphs are above or below the
              baseline.

              I think that for a while this will be the last larger update to
              this font. If I notice something there might be a hotfix or two,
              but nothing more than that. Despite that, I hope you'll enjoy
              using this font wherever you want.
